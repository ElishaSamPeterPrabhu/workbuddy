## ✅ What We Did

1. **Google Calendar Integration (In Progress)**
   - Scaffolded `integrations/calendar.py` with robust, typed CRUD methods for events (add, update, delete, fetch).
   - Implemented OAuth2 authentication and event fetching (pending credentials.json setup).
   - Ready for notification logic, daily summary, and AI/JSON protocol wiring.

2. **File Search Module (Complete)**
   - Implemented `core/filesearch.py` with a dynamic shell command runner.
   - Allows AI to return file search commands, which are safely executed and results returned.
   - Robust error handling, logging, and timeout support.

3. **Notifications & Reminders (Complete)**
   - Persistent, actionable notifications using winotify.
   - Reminders are fully implemented, persistent, and integrated with the notification system.

4. **AI/JSON Protocol**
   - System prompt and backend logic support structured actions for reminders, GitHub, and (soon) file search and calendar.

## ⏸️ What's Left To Do (Next Steps)

1. **Google Calendar**
   - Complete credentials.json setup and test CRUD operations.
   - Implement notification logic for upcoming meetings and daily summary at startup.
   - Wire up AI/JSON protocol for calendar actions.

2. **File Search**
   - Integrate file search action into AI/JSON protocol and backend handler.
   - Add UI for displaying file search results.
   - Optionally, add safety/whitelisting for allowed commands.

3. **UI/UX**
   - Continue refining overlay, tray, and input/response flow.
   - Add settings and notification center.

4. **Testing & Docs**
   - Expand pytest coverage for new modules.
   - Update README and user/developer documentation.

---

**Current State:**
- Google Calendar and file search are now core parts of the architecture.
- Notifications and reminders are robust and persistent.
- AI/JSON protocol is the backbone for all user/AI actions.

**Next Focus:**
- Finish Google Calendar integration (after credentials).
- Wire up file search to AI/JSON protocol.
- Continue UI/UX and settings improvements.

## Checkpoint Log

### [2024-06-09] Persistent Reminders & Notification System

**Key Steps Completed:**

1. **Persistent Storage Layer**
   - Implemented `core/storage.py` using SQLite.
   - Database file is created at `%APPDATA%/WorkBuddy/workbuddy.db` for user-specific, persistent storage.
   - Tables for `reminders`, `notes`, and `notifications` are created and managed.

2. **Reminder Scheduling**
   - Added `core/scheduler.py` using APScheduler.
   - On app startup, all pending reminders are loaded from the database.
   - If a reminder is overdue, a "missed reminder" notification is fired and the reminder is marked as done.
   - Future reminders are scheduled with APScheduler and persist across restarts.

3. **Notification System**
   - Created `notifications.py` using `win10toast` for Windows notifications.
   - All notifications are logged to the database for history.
   - Notifications are non-blocking and have a default timeout.

4. **Agent Integration for Reminders**
   - Enhanced `ai_client.py` to parse natural language "remind me" commands using regex and `dateparser`.
   - When a reminder command is detected, the agent schedules the reminder and confirms to the user.
   - Example: "Remind me in 10 minutes to run for a min" schedules a persistent reminder.

5. **Testing & Debugging**
   - Confirmed that reminders are stored in the database and notifications are shown at the correct time.
   - Provided instructions for using DB Browser for SQLite to inspect the database in real time.

6. **Next Steps Identified**
   - Add ability to cancel/delete reminders before they occur.
   - Optionally, build a UI for viewing and managing reminders and notification history.
   - Debug any issues with database file creation or reminder visibility.
